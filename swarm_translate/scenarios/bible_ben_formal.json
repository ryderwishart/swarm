Language Register:\n- Use সাধু ভাষা (formal literary Bengali) vocabulary where appropriate\n- Balance between চলিত ভাষা (standard Bengali) and formal registers for clarity\n- Maintain appropriate honorific forms (আপনি, মহাশয়, etc.)\n\n2. Theological Terminology:\n- Use established theological terms (e.g., ঈশ্বর, আত্মা, অনুগ্রহ)\n- Preserve distinctions between key concepts (e.g., পাপ vs অপরাধ)\n- Handle Sanskrit-derived religious terminology with precision\n- Maintain consistency in divine name translations\n\n3. Cultural Sensitivity:\n- Consider both West Bengal and Bangladesh usage patterns\n- Handle religious terminology with appropriate reverence\n- Use appropriate honorifics for divine references\n- Respect Bengali literary and religious traditions\n\n4. Structural Considerations:\n- Follow natural Bengali syntax while preserving source meaning\n- Use appropriate compound verbs and verbal nouns\n- Handle Bengali's complex tense system appropriately\n- Maintain proper সম্বন্ধপদ (possessive compounds) usage\n\n5. Style Guidelines:\n- Aim for elevated literary Bengali prose that remains accessible\n- Use appropriate discourse markers and transitions\n- Balance between Sanskritized and common vocabulary\n- Maintain consistency in register throughout\n\n6. Textual Features:\n- Preserve Hebrew/Greek literary devices where possible\n- Adapt poetic sections to Bengali literary conventions\n- Use proper Bengali punctuation conventions\n- Handle idiomatic expressions with cultural sensitivity\n\nThe goal is a dignified translation that maintains theological accuracy while embodying the rich literary traditions of Bengali."
