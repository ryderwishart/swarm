Use modern English idioms and terminology, and avoid archaic language. When multiple valid translation options exist, choose clear, precise language that best conveys the original meaning - and aim to retain source-culture idioms and terminology wherever possible. Use LORD in caps for the tetragrammaton. Maintain theological and traditional religious terminology where it best represents the source concepts. The goal is a faithful translation that uses language that millennials actually use in spoken and general written registers (e.g., emails, etc.). Avoid archiaic bible-ese language."
