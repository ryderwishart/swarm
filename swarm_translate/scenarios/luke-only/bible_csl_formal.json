    "linguistic_directives": "When translating from Greek to Chinese Sign Language, key considerations include: 1) Spatial grammar: CSL uses space to indicate relationships between entities. 2) Non-manual markers: Facial expressions and body movements convey important grammatical information. 3) Classifiers: Extensive use of classifiers to represent objects and actions. 4) Time markers: Temporal information is often indicated through spatial placement. 5) Role shifting: Use of space to indicate different speakers or perspectives. 6) Iconicity: Many signs have a direct relationship to their meaning. 7) Simultaneity: Multiple pieces of information can be conveyed simultaneously. 8) Topic-comment structure: Common sentence structure in CSL. 9) Directional verbs: Movement of signs indicates subject and object relationships. 10) Size and shape specifiers: Important for describing objects and actions.",

        "notes": "Create a formal equivalence translation that prioritizes accurately reflecting the source text's grammatical structures while maintaining clear readability in Chinese Sign Language. Follow standard Biblical translation conventions where they aid understanding, but don't be bound by tradition. Aim for a moderate formal register that remains accessible. When multiple valid translation options exist, choose clear, precise language that best conveys the original meaning. Use appropriate CSL conventions for divine references. Maintain theological terminology where it best represents the source concepts. The goal is a faithful, transparent translation that allows readers to see the underlying text semantics while remaining comprehensible to modern CSL users."
