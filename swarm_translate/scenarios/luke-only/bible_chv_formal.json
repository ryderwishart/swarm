    "linguistic_directives": "When translating from Greek to Chuvash, key considerations include: 1) Word order: Chuvash follows Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order, unlike Greek's more flexible order. 2) Tense system: Chuvash has a rich tense system with present, past, future, and perfect tenses. 3) Gender: Chuvash has no grammatical gender. 4) Honorifics: Multiple levels of respect encoded in pronouns and verbs. 5) Postpositions: Chuvash uses postpositions instead of prepositions. 6) Case marking: Extensive case marking system affecting nouns and pronouns. 7) Verb agreement: Verbs agree with subject in person and number. 8) Aspect: Important distinction between perfective and imperfective aspects. 9) Vowel harmony: Important phonological feature affecting word formation. 10) Agglutination: Heavy use of suffixes for grammatical functions.",

        "notes": "Create a formal equivalence translation that prioritizes accurately reflecting the source text's grammatical structures while maintaining clear readability in Chuvash. Follow standard Biblical translation conventions where they aid understanding, but don't be bound by tradition. Aim for a moderate formal register that remains accessible. When multiple valid translation options exist, choose clear, precise language that best conveys the original meaning. Use appropriate Chuvash honorifics for divine references. Maintain theological terminology where it best represents the source concepts. The goal is a faithful, transparent translation that allows readers to see the underlying text semantics while remaining comprehensible to modern Chuvash speakers."
