    "linguistic_directives": "When translating from Greek to Dari, key considerations include: 1) Word order: Dari follows Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) order, unlike Greek's more flexible order. 2) Tense system: Dari has a rich tense system with present, past, future, and perfect tenses. 3) Gender: Dari has two genders (masculine and feminine) affecting verb agreement. 4) Honorifics: Multiple levels of respect encoded in pronouns and verbs. 5) Postpositions: Dari uses postpositions instead of prepositions. 6) Case marking: Extensive case marking system affecting nouns and pronouns. 7) Verb agreement: Verbs agree with both subject and object in person and number. 8) Aspect: Important distinction between perfective and imperfective aspects. 9) Ezafe construction: Important grammatical feature for linking nouns and adjectives. 10) Definiteness: Marked through various means including the definite suffix -ra.",

        "notes": "Create a formal equivalence translation that prioritizes accurately reflecting the source text's grammatical structures while maintaining clear readability in Dari. Follow standard Biblical translation conventions where they aid understanding, but don't be bound by tradition. Aim for a moderate formal register that remains accessible. When multiple valid translation options exist, choose clear, precise language that best conveys the original meaning. Use appropriate Dari honorifics for divine references. Maintain theological terminology where it best represents the source concepts. The goal is a faithful, transparent translation that allows readers to see the underlying text semantics while remaining comprehensible to modern Dari speakers."
