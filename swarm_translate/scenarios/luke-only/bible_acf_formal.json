    "linguistic_directives": "When translating from Greek to Lesser Antillean French Creole, key considerations include: 1) Word order: ACF follows Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order, similar to Greek. 2) Tense system: ACF uses aspect markers and auxiliary verbs. 3) Gender: ACF has two genders (masculine and feminine). 4) Honorifics: Multiple levels of respect encoded in pronouns and titles. 5) Prepositions: ACF uses prepositions similar to Greek. 6) Case marking: Limited case marking system. 7) Verb agreement: Verbs agree with subject in person and number. 8) Aspect: Important distinction between perfective and imperfective aspects. 9) Serial verbs: Common use of serial verb constructions. 10) Reduplication: Used for emphasis and plurality. 11) Definite articles: Important for marking specificity. 12) Negation: Multiple negation markers for different contexts.",

        "notes": "Create a formal equivalence translation that prioritizes accurately reflecting the source text's grammatical structures while maintaining clear readability in Lesser Antillean French Creole. Follow standard Biblical translation conventions where they aid understanding, but don't be bound by tradition. Aim for a moderate formal register that remains accessible. When multiple valid translation options exist, choose clear, precise language that best conveys the original meaning. Use appropriate ACF honorifics for divine references. Maintain theological terminology where it best represents the source concepts. The goal is a faithful, transparent translation that allows readers to see the underlying text semantics while remaining comprehensible to modern ACF speakers."
