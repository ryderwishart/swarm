    "linguistic_directives": "When translating from Greek to Latin American Spanish, key considerations include: 1) Word order: Spanish follows Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order, similar to Greek. 2) Tense system: Spanish uses aspect markers and auxiliary verbs. 3) Gender: Spanish has two grammatical genders. 4) Honorifics: Multiple levels of respect encoded in pronouns and titles. 5) Prepositions: Spanish uses prepositions similar to Greek. 6) Case marking: No case marking system. 7) Verb agreement: Verb agreement with subject. 8) Aspect: Important distinction between perfective and imperfective aspects. 9) Regional variations: Latin American Spanish has unique vocabulary and expressions. 10) Code-switching: Common mixing with local languages. 11) Reduplication: Common use of reduplication for emphasis. 12) Serial verbs: Common use of serial verb constructions.",

        "notes": "Create a formal equivalence translation that prioritizes accurately reflecting the source text's grammatical structures while maintaining clear readability in Latin American Spanish. Follow standard Biblical translation conventions where they aid understanding, but don't be bound by tradition. Aim for a moderate formal register that remains accessible. When multiple valid translation options exist, choose clear, precise language that best conveys the original meaning. Use appropriate Spanish honorifics for divine references. Maintain theological terminology where it best represents the source concepts. The goal is a faithful, transparent translation that allows readers to see the underlying text semantics while remaining comprehensible to modern Latin American Spanish speakers."
