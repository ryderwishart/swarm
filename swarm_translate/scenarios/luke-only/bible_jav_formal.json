    "linguistic_directives": "When translating from Greek to Javanese, key considerations include: 1) Word order: Javanese follows Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order, similar to Greek. 2) Tense system: Javanese has a rich tense system with present, past, future, and perfect tenses. 3) Gender: Javanese has no grammatical gender. 4) Honorifics: Complex system of speech levels (ngoko, madya, krama) affecting vocabulary and grammar. 5) Prepositions: Javanese uses prepositions similar to Greek. 6) Case marking: Limited case marking system using particles. 7) Verb agreement: No verb agreement with subject. 8) Aspect: Important distinction between perfective and imperfective aspects. 9) Reduplication: Common use of reduplication for emphasis and plurality. 10) Passive voice: Frequent use of passive constructions.",

        "notes": "Create a formal equivalence translation that prioritizes accurately reflecting the source text's grammatical structures while maintaining clear readability in Javanese. Follow standard Biblical translation conventions where they aid understanding, but don't be bound by tradition. Aim for a moderate formal register using appropriate speech levels (krama). When multiple valid translation options exist, choose clear, precise language that best conveys the original meaning. Use appropriate Javanese honorifics for divine references. Maintain theological terminology where it best represents the source concepts. The goal is a faithful, transparent translation that allows readers to see the underlying text semantics while remaining comprehensible to modern Javanese speakers."
