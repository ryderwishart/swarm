    "linguistic_directives": "When translating from Greek to Modern Hebrew, key considerations include: 1) Word order: Hebrew follows Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) order, unlike Greek's more flexible order. 2) Tense system: Hebrew has a rich tense system with present, past, future, and perfect tenses. 3) Gender: Hebrew has two genders (masculine and feminine) affecting verb agreement. 4) Honorifics: Multiple levels of respect encoded in pronouns and verbs. 5) Prepositions: Hebrew uses prepositions similar to Greek. 6) Case marking: Limited case marking system affecting nouns and pronouns. 7) Verb agreement: Verbs agree with subject in person, number, and gender. 8) Aspect: Important distinction between perfective and imperfective aspects. 9) Definiteness: Marked through the definite article ה. 10) Construct state: Important grammatical feature for linking nouns. 11) Binyanim: Seven verb patterns affecting meaning and usage. 12) Gematria: Numerical values of letters may be significant in certain contexts.",

        "notes": "Create a formal equivalence translation that prioritizes accurately reflecting the source text's grammatical structures while maintaining clear readability in Modern Hebrew. Follow standard Biblical translation conventions where they aid understanding, but don't be bound by tradition. Aim for a moderate formal register that remains accessible. When multiple valid translation options exist, choose clear, precise language that best conveys the original meaning. Use appropriate Hebrew honorifics for divine references. Maintain theological terminology where it best represents the source concepts. The goal is a faithful, transparent translation that allows readers to see the underlying text semantics while remaining comprehensible to modern Hebrew speakers. Use יהוה for the tetragrammaton, following traditional Hebrew practice."
